# Transit timing protocols
Code for reading, fitting and analyzing TESS data + running MCMC to fit a decaying orbit model to detect how orbital period changes with epoch number.

TESS data:
1) [TESS cut](https://mast.stsci.edu/tesscut/) 
2) [TICs for each sector](https://tess.mit.edu/observations/sector-17/)
3) [2-minute cadence data](https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html)
